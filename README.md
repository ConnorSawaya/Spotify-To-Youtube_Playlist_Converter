# Spotify-To-Youtube_Playlist_Converter
Spotify-To-Youtube_Playlist_Converter using python 

This Converter uses youtube api + Spotify Api to first pull songs from your playlist, then search youtube using that api for the top listing(using artist name + song name)
it has worked every single time i tried it, gives the correct link and works fast.
The only downside i can really tell right now is that youtube api has limits on the searches... so thats not good but it still works ok for this.

To use it, 
Simplify click login with spotify on https://spotify-to-youtubeplaylistconverter-production.up.railway.app/
Then it should open a page saying do you want porter to have acess to your public playlists and see your name etc... all this is doing is requesting your public playlists so the porter can pull that data to convert it.

if you want to use this on your own site or smth 
you can get a FREE Api key from youtube and just set it as a env variable
but for spotify for web api you need spotify premium BUT you get so many requests!!!
